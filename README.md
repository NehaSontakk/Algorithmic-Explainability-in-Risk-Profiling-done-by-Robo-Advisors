# Operationalizing explanations of the risk profiling algorithm used by robo financial advisory apps.
## Why?
<br>
There is a growing ubiquity regarding the decision-making algorithms that have started affecting people's lives. Our research is an attempt to operationalize the concept of explainability in automated tools used in fintech. We have selected the case of robo financial advisory apps which conduct a risk profiling of users based on a questionnaire and use it to give them investment advice. These algorithms are subjected to regulations in India and several other countries. However, regulators without the technical knowledge possess no means to understand the algorithms and test it themselves. Our research explores various explainability methods and implements it.
